##Which language it use ?
This plugin use php (of course for a plugin Wordpress ...), JQuery for the window, javascript for the countdown, and some html and css (but sure you guest it ...)

##So ... This is an "Anti-Trump" plugin ?
Actualy .. I didn't coded this as an "anti-Trump" plugin but more like a "funny-plugin" ... Which use Donald Trump I don't want to take part about this debate, I'm neither pro or anti-trump ;)
